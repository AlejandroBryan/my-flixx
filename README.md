## Description 
In this Repository, I will implement my learned skill on the intro to server-side programming at [Carrerfoundry](https://careerfoundry.com). It consists of building an API "Application Programming Interface" where the client side is able to insert, read, edit, and delete data according to its assigned role.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Could you make sure to have installed the following programs on your computer: Nodejs up version +14 and NPM? 

### Executing program

```css
1- clone the application
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroBryan/my-flixx.git


2- install all dependencies and devDependencies.

npm install 

3- run the application. 

npm run dev

The server will start running on port http://localhost:5000

npm run production

This command will create the `\dist` file which is our production-ready code.



```
**In order to keep code well organized and avoid bugs running sequentially**
```
npm run lint 
npm run format

```
